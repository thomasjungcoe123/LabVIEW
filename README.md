# LabVIEW

LabVIEW projects for controlled systems. These projects require LabVIEW in order to view the details

1.) Designed and programmed a calculator GUI in LabVIEW

2.) Designed and programmed a state machine GUI that checks for the current student, student ID, and their phone number 
for access to a room.

3.) Designed and programmed a Dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling GUI that detects correct phone number through 
filtering frequencies from user pressing and releasing a keypad on a telephone.

4.) Research conducted using LabVIEW to determine safety level through calculating alpha, omega, displacement, velocity, 
and acceleration using engineering disciplines. Actual data was acquired physically in the lab through a lab instrument 
in order to perform scientific research on this topic.
