mass
spring
fixed position

damping factor
e^-al damping neg exponential

at 0, laplace transformation = fourerir trans

eigen function




...
omega is the eigenvalue


we wil collect just the a(t).

find freq

find peaks

exponential fit

A(x) can be found with an actual ruler



Key things to report

sampling frequency
       bin size, sampling type (rse), dynamic range
(power by single 5 voltage supply) --> minimum is 0.




Frequency crossover
